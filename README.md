# uims-bot

- A telegram bot for getting push notifications for announcements from https://cuims.in/
  on your smart phone.

- I can't say if this bot works or not at the moment since their website hardly opens
  as long as you are not on their local network. I haven't been able to test it lately.

## Installation and Usage

```
git clone https://github.com/ritiek/uims-bot
cd uims-bot
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create and add the bot to a channel and specify its token and channel name in the source
([here](https://github.com/ritiek/uims-bot/blob/0d16ff6505764650a24bd5557c7cd659b2073ce4/uims_bot.py#L9-L13)).

Start the bot using
```
python uims_bot.py
```
